This add-on is focused not on creating a better internet experience but in drawing attention to the ambiguities that already exist. Do you trust your search engine? Do you understand how images are displayed and why you see the things you do? My intention is to create a process where the ambiguities slowly become obvious. 

I will do this by:
- trading images
- substituting images
- switching words
- markov chaining selective text
